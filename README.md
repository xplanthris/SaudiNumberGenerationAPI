# SaudiNumberGenerationAPI
An API to generate correct Saudi phone numbers every-time.
Truth be told, this was made for a friend and made its' way onto Github for easy deployment.

# Usage instructions
Clone the repository from Github and then you want to go into it and run ```npm i```.
Now you can run ```node app.js```.

# Contributions
All contributions are welcome since I'm no super coder or anything...
